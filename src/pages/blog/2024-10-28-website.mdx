Contrary to the name of the [repo](https://github.com/phthallo/site-v1), this is not actually version one of my website. Here's a comprehensive timeline of my history with web development:
<Timeline timeline={[
    {"title": "fandom wiki shenanigans", "date": "June 2019", "desc": "I start off doing random HTML and CSS changes to personalise my profile on a short-lived Fandom Wiki, and apparently proclaim myself as 'that CSS Freak' (I do not remember doing this)." },
    {"title": "???", "date": "???", "desc": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" },

    {"title": "phthallo.com", "date": "September 2024", "desc": "You are here. Originally HTML + CSS, then ported to Astro, then TailwindCSS was added."}
    ]}
></Timeline>

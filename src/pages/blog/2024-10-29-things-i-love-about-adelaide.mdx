- The beaches. I really like Hallett Cove.
- [Mount Lofty Botanic Garden](https://www.botanicgardens.sa.gov.au/visit/mount-lofty-botanic-garden) and [Morialta Conservation Park](https://www.parks.sa.gov.au/parks/morialta-conservation-park), for a beautiful, scenic walk.
- The [Adelaide Fringe](https://adelaidefringe.com.au/), the world's second largest arts festival.
- Further south-east: the Coorong River (see images) and the caves of [Naracoorte National Park](https://www.naracoortecaves.sa.gov.au/). It's a long drive, but worth it.
- The Mortlock Wing of South Australia's State Library.
- Walking around the CBD, through buildings and warehouses, exploring the many exhibits of [Illuminate Adelaide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVGlv8MyG2c) 
- Home of acclaimed indie game [Hollow Knight's developers!](https://www.teamcherry.com.au/)
- The random sculptures which give Rundle Mall its personality (the Malls Balls [sic], the giant pigeon, and the bronze pigs™️)
- Standing on the bridge over the Torrens River at Elder Park at sunset. 
- [Hahndorf](https://hahndorfsa.org.au/) during autumn.
- The Nan Hai Pu Tuo temple; a very serene Buddhist temple in Sellicks Hill which overlooks the coast.
